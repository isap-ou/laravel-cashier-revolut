# isapp/laravel-cashier-revolut

## Purpose

Concrete implementation of `isapp/laravel-cashier-support` contracts for **Revolut Merchant API**.
Analogous to `laravel/cashier-stripe` for Stripe and `laravel/cashier-paddle` for Paddle —
those two are the references this driver is measured against. `mollie/laravel-cashier-mollie`
is a last resort only: it builds its own local subscription engine, which the smart-stub rule
forbids.

The user adds `use \Isapp\CashierSupport\Billable;` to the User model
and works with the standard Cashier API — everything routes through Revolut.

## Revolut API

Primary API: **Revolut Merchant API**. Read the reference as markdown, one file per
operation — `https://developer.revolut.com/docs/api/merchant/operations/<operation>.md`
(curl + a browser User-Agent; `WebFetch` 403s and the HTML is JS-rendered). See
`.claude/rules/sources-of-truth.md`.
Version: `2026-04-20` (header `Revolut-Api-Version`)

Merchant API capabilities:
- **Orders** — create orders (analogous to Stripe PaymentIntent)
- **Payments** — process payments on an order
- **Customers** — create/manage customers, save payment methods
- **Subscription Plans** — plan-based model with variations and phases (trial, monthly, yearly)
- **Subscriptions** — create, list, get, update, cancel, change plan (no native pause/resume endpoints)
- **Billing Cycles** — first-class concept with dedicated endpoints per subscription
- **Webhooks** — ORDER_COMPLETED, ORDER_PAYMENT_DECLINED, ORDER_PAYMENT_FAILED, SUBSCRIPTION_INITIATED, SUBSCRIPTION_FINISHED, SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELLED, SUBSCRIPTION_OVERDUE
- **Checkout Widget** — JS widget for accepting payments (analogous to Stripe Elements)

Authorization: API keys from the Revolut Business dashboard.

## Mapping Stripe → Revolut

| Stripe Cashier            | Revolut Merchant API                         |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| PaymentIntent             | POST /orders → POST /orders/{id}/payments    |
| Customer                  | POST /customers                              |
| Subscription              | Revolut Subscriptions API (plan-based)        |
| SetupIntent               | Save card via Checkout Widget                |
| Checkout Session          | Revolut Checkout Widget / hosted page        |
| Webhook (stripe/webhook)  | POST webhook → ORDER_COMPLETED etc.          |
| Invoice                   | Local generation via cashier-support           |
| PaymentMethod (list/get/delete) | GET/DELETE /customers/{id}/payment-methods |
| PaymentMethod (add)       | Not supported (only via checkout widget)      |
| Refund                    | POST /orders/{id}/refund                     |

## Key differences from Stripe

1. **Subscriptions** — plan-based model (plan → variation → phases) vs Stripe's price-based. No native pause/resume endpoints (`paused` state exists but no API trigger). Swap exists as a separate command (`POST /subscriptions/{id}/change-plan`), but is scheduled at cycle end — never prorated, and it skips a trial on the target variation. Update limited to `external_reference` only. Unsupported operations throw `UnsupportedOperationException`.
2. **Invoices** — Revolut has no invoice API. Generated locally by cashier-support from payment/subscription data.
3. **Checkout** — Revolut Checkout Widget (JS) instead of Stripe Checkout hosted page.
4. **Currency** — Revolut supports 30+ currencies, amounts in minor units (cents).

## Configuration (.env)

```
REVOLUT_SECRET_KEY=sk_xxx
REVOLUT_SANDBOX=false
REVOLUT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=wsk_xxx
REVOLUT_API_VERSION=2026-04-20
CASHIER_CURRENCY=eur
CASHIER_CURRENCY_LOCALE=en_IE
```

## Rules

- `declare(strict_types=1)` everywhere
- HTTP via `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http` (not Guzzle directly)
- All public methods — PHPDoc
- PSR-12 (Pint), PHPStan level 8 (Larastan)
- Tests: Mockery for HTTP, Testbench for integration, 100% coverage

## Known divergences from the reference drivers (audited 2026-07-14)

Both reference `WebhookController`s were compared against ours method-by-method. Two open
issues — **do not work around either locally, and do not assume the webhook layer is done**:

- **#24** (bug) — `WebhookReceived` is dispatched at `RevolutWebhookController.php:78`, i.e.
  **after** `parseWebhook()` (`:64`). An event type outside the 8 cases of `RevolutWebhookEvent`
  throws, is caught, and returns a bare 200 (`:65-75`) — so it never reaches a listener.
  In both references `WebhookReceived` fires *first*, precisely so it is the universal escape
  hatch for events the package does not map. We also removed the other escape hatch: the
  references let an app subclass `WebhookController` and add `handleXxx()`, while
  `RevolutWebhookSynchronizer` is `private` methods behind a closed `match` (`:77-86`).
  **Net: an app cannot react to any event we did not map.**
- **#25** — no customer-lifecycle webhooks at all. Stripe handles customer updated/deleted and
  payment-method auto-update (`WebhookController.php:240-286`); we handle none, so a customer
  deleted at Revolut leaves a local record claiming an active subscription against a dead id.
  Pairs with support#36 (no local → gateway sync) — the drift is bidirectional.

Where this driver is deliberately **better** than the references (keep it): signature
verification is mandatory and a missing secret is a hard failure (both references silently skip
verification when the secret is unset), `throttle` on the webhook route, transient-only retry
with exponential backoff, idempotency via `updateOrCreate` + `wasRecentlyCreated` gating.

## Navigating this package — use the graph, not grep

`graphify-out/graph.json` exists (AST + semantic). Start here instead of reading `src/` file by
file — and note the cross-package graph at `../../../graphify-refs/merged/`, which is the only
place where "which support contract does `RevolutGateway` implement" is a single query.

```bash
graphify query "how does the webhook reach the synchronizer"
graphify explain "RevolutWebhookSynchronizer"
graphify path "RevolutGateway" "GatewayProvider"    # needs the merged graph (--graph)
graphify affected "RevolutWebhookEvent"             # what breaks if I add an event
```

After changing code: `graphify update .` (AST-only, no LLM cost).
